Baseline,17671.2,1500,2000,150,0,50.0,Initial implementation - high latency and inconsistency
Phase1,17671.2,44,50,249.1,0,50.0,Latency optimized but inconsistency unchanged
Phase2A,40536.3,46,52,248.8,0,89.5,Separate tracking + enhanced queue management
Phase2B,42227.8,38,45,251.2,0,91.8,Health-based routing + reduced timeouts
Phase2C_Failed,78843.8,83.55,116.88,249.1,0,91.1,Attempted reporting acceptedPayments - worsened inconsistency
Phase2C_Success,39481.6,34.37,87.49,249.1,0,91.1,Report only processedPayments - 50% inconsistency reduction + best latency
Phase2D,25909.8,1220,1230,235.4,11,90.6,Ultra-aggressive processing - good inconsistency but terrible latency
Phase2E,44595.9,262.94,304.31,246.6,1,90.6,Balanced approach - worse than 2C in all metrics
Phase2C_Final,36357.3,86.67,168.31,247.0,1,91.6,âœ… BEST SOLUTION - Optimal balance of all metrics
