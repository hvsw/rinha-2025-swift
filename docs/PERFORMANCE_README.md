- **`analyze_performance.sh`** - Quick visualization script for performance data
- **`OPTIMIZATION_PLAN.md`** - Detailed phase-by-phase optimization plan

## 🎯 Current Status

| **Metric** | **Baseline** | **Current (Phase 2B)** | **Improvement** | **Target** |
|------------|--------------|-------------------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Latency P99** | 1,500ms | 104.48ms | **93% ↓** | < 100ms |
| **Throughput** | 196.9 req/s | 249.2 req/s | **27% ↑** | > 250 req/s |
| **Inconsistency** | 55,680.20 | 42,227.80 | **24% ↓** | **0** ⚠️ |
| **Failures** | 11.7% | 0.01% | **99.9% ↓** | 0% |
| **Total Transactions** | 10,594 | 15,171 | **43% ↑** | > 15,000 |

## 🔍 Key Optimization Phases

### ✅ **Phase 1: Asynchronous Processing** (COMPLETED)
**Impact**: 4,578% latency improvement, eliminated blocking
- Implemented Actor pattern with background queue processing
- HTTP 202 immediate responses instead of synchronous calls
- Background workers with batch processing and exponential backoff
- **Result**: P99 latency 1,500ms → 44.01ms

### 🔶 **Phase 2: Consistency Optimization** (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
**Impact**: Performance maintained, but inconsistency remains critical
- Separated tracking of accepted vs processed payments
- Attempted aggressive queue flushing (caused regression)
- Corrected with lighter processing approach
- **Result**: Inconsistency reduced but still at 42,227.8

### 🎯 **Phase 2C: ROOT CAUSE FIX** (NEXT PRIORITY)
**Target**: Eliminate inconsistency completely
- **Root Cause Identified**: `/payments-summary` reports PROCESSED payments instead of ACCEPTED
- **K6 expects**: Summary to match what it considers "successful" (HTTP 202 responses)
- **Fix**: Change summary endpoint to count all accepted payments

## 🧪 Testing Strategy Enhancement

### Swift Unit Tests for Rapid Iteration
Implemented local Swift tests to debug race conditions and validate hypotheses:
- **`ConsistencyTests.swift`** - Race condition debugging
- **Feedback loop**: Seconds instead of minutes (vs Docker + K6)
- **Real-time queue monitoring** with `QueueStats`

### Key Findings from Tests:
1. **Inconsistency formula**: `accepted_payments - processed_payments`
2. **Payment processor failures** cause payments to remain in queue
3. **K6 calculation**: Compares backend summary vs processor summary amounts

## 📈 Performance Metrics Explained

### **Critical Metrics (Rinha Scoring)**
- **Inconsistency**: ZERO required for good score (current: 42,227.8 ❌)
- **DEFAULT Processor %**: Maximize (lower fees) - current: 90.6% ✅
- **Total Processed**: Maximize transactions - current: 15,171 ✅

### **Performance Metrics**
- **Latency P99**: < 100ms target - current: 104.48ms ⚠️
- **Throughput**: > 250 req/s target - current: 249.2 req/s ✅
- **Failure Rate**: 0% target - current: 0.01% ✅

## 🛠️ Usage Instructions

### View Performance History
```bash
./analyze_performance.sh
```

### Run Swift Tests for Debugging
```bash
swift test --filter ConsistencyTests
```

### Full K6 Performance Test
```bash
cd ../../rinha-test && k6 run rinha.js --summary-export=results-summary.json
```

### Update Performance History
After each test, update `performance_history.csv` with:
- New phase name and date
- All metrics from K6 results
- Comment explaining the main change

## 🎯 Next Steps Priority

1. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Fix payments-summary endpoint (Phase 2C)
2. **🟡 OPTIMIZATION**: Fine-tune latency to consistently < 100ms
3. **🟢 ENHANCEMENT**: Increase DEFAULT processor usage to > 95%

## 📝 Comments Guidelines

When adding entries to `performance_history.csv`:
- **Be specific** about the main technical change
- **Include impact** (positive/negative) in the comment
- **Reference issue** if it caused regression
- **Use emoji** for quick visual scanning (✅❌⚠️)
